## First Things First: The Data-Generating Process (DGP) {.smaller}

* From economic microfoundations, can derive that production cost curves (in presence of *economies of scale*) tend to take on forms like

$$
C(x) = 250 + 195x - 24x^2 + x^3
$$

```{r}
#| label: cubic-dgp
library(tidyverse)
compute_prod_cost <- function(x) {
    return(250 + 195*x - 24*(x^2) + x^3)
}
N <- 500
x_vals <- runif(N, min=0, max=16)
y_raw = compute_prod_cost(x_vals)
y_noise = rnorm(N, mean=0, sd=100)
y_vals <- y_raw + y_noise
prod_df <- tibble(x=x_vals, y=y_vals)
prod_df |> ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic(base_size=22)
```
