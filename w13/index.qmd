## Roadmap {.crunch-title .crunch-ul-full .title-10 .text-80 .crunch-li-8 .crunch-li-last}

::: {.callout-note title="<i class='bi bi-1-circle'></i> What makes **causation** different from correlation?" icon="false"}

* Why can't we use, e.g., Regression to infer **causal effects**? *$\uparrow X$ by 1 unit ~~causes~~ $\uparrow Y$ by $\beta$ units*?
* $\leadsto$ Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

:::

::: {.callout-note title="<i class='bi bi-2-circle'></i> Key to resolving Fundamental Problem: *Match* similar observations" icon="false"}

* **Apples to apples**: If $j$ receives drug while $i$ doesn't, and they're $s_{ij}\%$ similar otherwise (age, height)...
* Higher $s_{ij}$ $\implies$ more confidence in attributing difference in outcomes $\boxed{\Delta y = y_j - y_i}$ to drug!
* $\leadsto$ Propensity Score Matching ($\approx$ Logistic Regression)

:::

::: {.callout-note title="<i class='bi bi-3-circle'></i> How can ML help us infer **counterfactual** effects?" icon="false"}

* Patient *$i$ didn't receive treatment, reported [VAS pain level](https://www.physio-pedia.com/McGill_Pain_Questionnaire) $y^0_i = 80$...*
* *If $i$ **had** received treatment, what would their pain level $y_i^1$ be?*
* $\leadsto$ Causal Forests, to estimate $\boxed{\Delta y_i = y^1_i - y^0_i}$

# The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference {data-stack-name="Fundamental Problem"}


## The *Fundamental* Problem of Causal Inference {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-callout .title-07}

The only workable definition of "$X$ causes $Y$":

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="<i class='bi bi-info-circle pe-1'></i> Defining Causality [@hume_treatise_1739]"}

$X$ causes $Y$ if and only if:

1. $X$ **temporally precedes** $Y$ and
2. 
    * In **two worlds** $W_0$ and $W_1$ where everything is **exactly the same**...
    * ...**except that** $\boxed{X = 0 \text{  in  } W_0}$ and $\boxed{X = 1 \text{  in  } W_1}$,
    * $\boxed{Y = 0 \text{  in  } W_0}$ and $\boxed{Y = 1 \text{  in  } W_1}$.

:::

* The problem? We live in **one** world, not two simultaneous worlds 😭

## Can't We Just Use Temporal Precedence? {.title-08 .crunch-title}

* Can't we just pretend that $W_0$ is our world at time $t$ and $W_1$ is our world at time $t + 1$?
* Did throwing the eraser at Sam at time $t$ **cause** him to be upset at time $t + 1$?
* No, because at time $t$, simultaneous with my eraser-throwing, a **cockroach** scuttled across his foot, the *true* cause of him being upset at time $t + 1$
* Without knowing that the worlds are **identical except for the posited cause-event**, we can't exclude the possibility of some other cause-event

## Extreme Example: Super Mario 64 Speedrunning {.smaller .crunch-title .title-10 .crunch-quarto-figure .crunch-blockquote .crunch-p .crunch-img}

Seemingly-reasonable assumption: Button-pushes cause outcomes in games...

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

> During the race, an ionizing particle from outer space collided with DOTA_Teabag's N64, flipping the eighth bit of Mario's first height byte. Specifically, it flipped the byte from 11000101 to 11000100, from "C5" to "C4". This resulted in a height change from C5837800 to C4837800, which by complete chance, happened to be the exact amount needed to warp Mario up to the higher floor at that exact moment.

> This was tested by pannenkoek12 - the same person who put up the bounty - using a script that manually flipped that particular bit at the right time, confirming the suspicion of a bit flip.

## What About A-B Testing? {.crunch-title .title-09 .crunch-li-8}

* Gets us significantly closer, but methods for **recovering** causal effect require a condition called **SUTVA**
* **S**table **U**nit **T**reatment **V**alue **A**ssumption: Treatment applied to $i$ does not affect outcome for another person $j$
* If we A-B test an **app redesign** (A = old design, B = new design), and outcome = length of time spent on app...
* Person $i$ seeing design A may like the new design, causing them to spend more time on the app
* Person $i$ may then **message** person $j$ *"Check out [app], they redesigned everything!"*, causing $j$ to spend more time on app regardless of treatment (network spillover ❌)

## What Is To Be Done?

## Case Study: Military Inequality $\leadsto$ Military Success {.smaller .crunch-title .title-09 .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote .crunch-li-8}

* @lyall_divided_2020: "Treating certain ethnic groups as second-class citizens [...] leads victimized soldiers to subvert military authorities once war begins. The higher an army's inequality, the greater its rates of desertion, side-switching, and casualties"

> Matching constructs **pairs of belligerents** that are **similar** across a wide range of traits thought to dictate battlefield performance but that **vary** in levels of prewar inequality. The more similar the belligerents, the better our estimate of inequality's effects, as all other traits are shared and thus cannot explain observed differences in performance, helping assess how battlefield performance **would have** improved (declined) if the belligerent had a lower (higher) level of prewar inequality.
> 
> Since [non-matched] cases are **dropped** [...] selected cases are more representative of average belligerents/wars than outliers with few or no matches, [providing] surer ground for testing generalizability of the book's claims than focusing solely on canonical but unrepresentative usual suspects (Germany, the United States, Israel)

* Similarity score via Logistic Regression! Let's look at a [program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACVyPp1Fy6Y) that built health clinics in several villages: did health clinics **cause** lower infant mortality?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| label: village-overview
#| classes: vil-table
library(tidyverse)
village_df <- tribble(
  ~village_id, ~T, ~inf_mortality, 
  1, 1, 10,
  2, 1, 15,
  3, 1, 22,
  4, 1, 19,
  5, 0, 25,
  6, 0, 19,
  7, 0, 4,
  8, 0, 8,
  9, 0, 6
) |> mutate(T = factor(T))
village_df
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| label: mort-comparison
#| classes: vil-sum-table
village_df |> group_by(T) |>
  summarize(mean_mortality = mean(inf_mortality)) |>
  arrange(desc(T))
```

Health clinics **increased** mortality by 4.1?

## From "Controlling For" to "*How Well* Are We Controlling For?" {.smaller .crunch-title .title-10 .crunch-ul .crunch-details}

* By introducing covariates, we can see the **selection bias** at play...

  0.5, 0.01,

  0.6, 0.02,
  0.6, 0.01,
  0.5, 0.02,
  0.1, 0.04,
  0.3, 0.05,
  0.2, 0.04,
)
village_df <- bind_cols(village_df, covar_df)
village_df

* $\leadsto$ We're not comparing **apples to apples**! (*"Well, we're both villages"*)

## Logistic Regression of Treatment {.smaller .title-10 .crunch-title}

```{r}
#| label: prop-score-glm
#| code-fold: show
prop_model <- glm(
  T ~ poverty_rate + docs_per_capita,
  data=village_df, family="binomial"

summary(prop_model)
```

* We now have a **model of selection bias!** $\leadsto$ **match** observations with similar $\Pr(T)$

## Propensity Score = Logistic Regression Estimate {.smaller .crunch-title .title-10}

```{r}
#| label: prop-score-predict
#| code-fold: show
#| classes: vil-table
village_df$ps <- predict(prop_model, village_df, type="response")

## Propensity Score *Matching* = Distance Metric! {.smaller .crunch-title .title-10}

```{=html}
<style>
.vil-match tr:nth-child(2) {

  mutate(
    ps_dist = abs(ps - cur_ps)
  )
other_df |> select(-c(inf_mortality))
```

## Now in a For Loop... {.smaller .crunch-title .title-11}

```{r}
#| label: r-all-matches
#| classes: vil-table
for (i in 1:9) {
  cur_T <- village_df[i,"T"] |> pull()
  cur_ps <- village_df[i,"ps"] |> pull()
  # writeLines(paste0("Current village: T = ",cur_T,", ps = ",cur_ps))
  other_df <- village_df |> filter(T != cur_T) |>
    mutate(
      ps_dist = abs(ps - cur_ps)
    )
  match_id <- names(which.min(other_df$ps_dist))
  village_df[i,"match"] <- as.numeric(match_id)
}
village_df |> select(-inf_mortality)
```

## And Now We Compare Apples to Apples... {.smaller .crunch-title .title-11}

```{r}
#| label: matching-estimator
#| classes: vil-table
#| code-fold: show
treated_df <- village_df |> filter(T == 1)
(matched_df <- treated_df |> left_join(village_df, join_by(match == village_id)))
```

```{r}
#| label: apples-to-apples
#| code-fold: show
matched_df |> summarize(
  mean_tr = mean(inf_mortality.x),
  mean_control = mean(inf_mortality.y)
)
```

* $\leadsto$ Treatment effect $\approx$ **-7** 🥳
